## Security & Privacy

### Without Login

   - Set up RLS policies

2. **Payment Integration:**
   - Configure Stripe for subscription payments
   - Set up webhook to update subscription status after payment
   - Test payment flow

3. **Testing:**
   - Test all functionality with real Supabase instance
   - Verify export works on all supported platforms
   - Test subscription flow end-to-end

4. **Deployment:**
